# Minecraft-Pony-Rig

The model uses MineLittlePony image/skin files as the texture (64x64)

Multiple tails are at Pony/Body/Tail/..., so you need to hide the tail parts that you don't need if you want to change tail length.

Horn is at Pony/Neck/Head/Horn
Wings are at Pony/Body/Wings/...
Hide if not needed
