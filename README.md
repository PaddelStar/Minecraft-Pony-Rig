# Minecraft-Pony-Rig

The model uses MineLittlePony image/skin files as the texture <b>(64x64)</b><br>
Even though the texture needs to be 64x64, the bottom half is ignored. That means no unique texture for each invidual side (leg, body, wings) for now.

<br>

<p>Multiple tails are at Pony/Body/Tail/..., so you need to hide the tail parts that you don't need if you want to change tail length (and to prevent potential z-fighting).</p>

Horn is at Pony/Neck/Head/Horn
<br>Wings are at Pony/Body/Wings/...
<br>Hide if not needed
